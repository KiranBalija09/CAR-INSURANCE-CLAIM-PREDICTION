this very important to be noted as we are pushing to the github repo with new file 

git checkout barnach name (main/sub-branches)--will check for the branches
git beanch -- will check for the banch you are currently in
git add . --will addd ll the files to branches
git add specific file ---will add only specific file only
git fetch orgin  --fetch all remote branches 
git merge orgin/main --mergin main branch to current branch 

git branch -dr If you want to remove the local tracking copy of the remote branch but not touch the actual branch on GitHub:
EG:
git branch -dr origin/main
git branch -dr origin/testing
git branch          # shows local branches
git branch -r       # shows remote branches
git branch -a       # shows both
